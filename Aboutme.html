            <h2>I'm </h2>
            <h2>Harsha Vardhan Reddy Narredula,</h1>

            <p > A Computer Science Engineering student at MLR Institution of Technology. I love diving into the world of coding and tech.

                I've got a bunch of skills under my belt, like C, Java, Python, SQL, HTML, and CSS. I've even worked on some cool projects, like creating a virtual mouse using Python. It's all about finding smart solutions to real-world problems.
                
                One thing I'm really proud of is my work on the front end of an application. I helped make it look awesome and user-friendly. It's exciting to see how design and functionality come together!
                
                When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me in the kitchen cooking up something delicious. Cooking is my way of unwinding and experimenting with flavors.
                
                Oh, and I'm a huge fan of watching scientific exploration videos on YouTube. There's something fascinating about learning about the mysteries of the universe.
                
                I'm always eager to learn and grow, both academically and personally. My goal is to use my skills and passion to make a positive impact in the tech world.
